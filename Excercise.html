<h1>Exercise</h1>
<hr>

<h2> What is exercise?</h2>

<p> • Activity requiring physical effort, carried out to sustain or improve health and fitness.</p>

<h2>Why should we exercise?</h2>

<p>• The benefits of exercising is amazing here are just a few of them.<p>

<h3>Benefits of exercise:</h3>

<h4>The physical benefits:</h4>

<p> •	reduce your risk of a heart attack 
<br>•	manage your weight better 
<br>•	have a lower blood cholesterol level 
<br>•	lower the risk of type 2 diabetes and some cancers 
<br>•	have lower blood pressure 
<br>•	have stronger bones, muscles and joints and lower risk of developing osteoporosis 
<br>•	lower your risk of falls 
<br>•	recover better from periods of hospitalisation or bed rest 
<br>•	feel better – with more energy, a better mood, feel more relaxed and sleep better.</p>

<h4>The Mental Health benefits:</h4>

<p> •	Exercise may block negative thoughts or distract you from daily worries. 
<br>•	Exercising with others provides an opportunity for increased social contact. 
<br>•	Increased fitness may lift your mood and improve your sleep patterns. 
<br>•	Exercise may also change levels of chemicals in your brain, such as serotonin, endorphins and stress hormones.

<h3>How much exercise is recommended weekly for health benefits?</h3>

<p>The general recommendation is:
<br>•	Cardio (minimum amount of activity): At least 150 minutes of moderate cardio throughout the week.
<br>    It can be replaced with at least 75 minutes of intense cardio throughout the week or a combination of both.
<br>•	Strength training (highly recommended): Exercises involving major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week.
<br>•   For extra health benefits: Minimum cardio should be increased by an additional 300 minutes per week (moderate) or 150     <br>    minutes of (intense) cardio per week (or a combination of both)

<h3>How hard should you work out?</h3>

<p> Your heart rate is one of the best indicators of how hard your body is working during a workout.
<br>So being able to monitor your heart rate i.e. Telling how many beats per minute (BPM) your heart is beating at is <br>important to have an efficient workout.</p>

<p> When exercising the you can train at different ranges of intensity. The intensity level is depending on your <br>heart rate. Each level of intensity has different health benefits. You can determine your heartrate using a <br>heart rate monitor. The levels of intensity linked to a heart rate zone, below is the list of heart rate zones.

<h3>Heart Rate Zones</h3>

<p> There are five different heart rate zones. Below is a breakdown for what each heart rate zone is listed at in <br>terms of your HRMAX and the benefits for training within that zone.</p> 

<p> There are five different zones, 1–5. Below is a breakdown of what each heart rate zone means and
<br>what the benefits of training in that heart rate zone are.

<h5>HEART RATE ZONE 1: 50–60% OF HRMAX</h5>

<h5 id = "headingVerylight"> VERY LIGHT </h5>

<p>This is the very low intensity zone. Training at this intensity will boost your recovery and get you ready to train in the higher heart rate zones.
<br>To train at this intensity, pick sports during which you can easily control your heart rate, such as walking or cycling.</p>

<h5>HEART RATE ZONE 2: 60–70% OF HRMAX</h5>

<h5 id = "headinglight"> LIGHT </h5>

<p>Exercising in heart rate zone 2 feels light and you should be able to go on for a long time at this intensity.</p>

<p>This is the zone that improves your general endurance: your body will get better at oxidizing – burning – fat and your muscular <br>fitness will increase along with your capillary density.</p>

<p>Training in heart rate zone 2 is an essential part of every runner’s program. Keep at it and you’ll reap the benefits later.</p>

<h5>HEART RATE ZONE 3: 70–80% OF HRMAX</h5>

<h5 id = "headingModerate"> MODERATE </h5>

<p> Exercising in heart rate zone 3 is especially effective for improving the efficiency of blood circulation in the heart and skeletal muscles. <br>This is the zone in which that pesky lactic acid starts building up in your bloodstream.</p>

<p>Training in this HR zone will make moderate efforts easier and improve your efficiency.</p>

<img src="jogging.jpg"  width = "750" height = "460">

<h5 style = "text-align:center;">HEART RATE ZONE 4: 80–90% OF HRMAX</h5>

<h5 id = "headinghard"> HARD </h5>

<p>Heart rate zone 4 is where the going gets tough. You’ll be breathing hard and running aerobically.</p>

<p> If you train at this intensity, you’ll improve your speed endurance. Your body will get better at using carbohydrates for <br>energy and you’ll be able to withstand higher levels of lactic acid in your blood for longer.</p>

<img src="running.jpg"  width = "768" height = "530">

<h5>HEART RATE ZONE 5: 90–100% OF HRMAX</h5>

<h5 id = "headingmaximum"> MAXIMUM </h5>

<p>Heart rate zone 5 is your maximal effort. Your heart and your blood and respiratory system will be working at their maximal capacity.<br> Lactic acid will build up in your blood and after a few minutes you won’t be able to continue at this intensity.</p>

<p>If you’re just starting out or have only been training for some time, you probably won’t have to train at this intensity.<br> If you’re a professional athlete, look into incorporating interval training into your training plan for peak performance.</p>
