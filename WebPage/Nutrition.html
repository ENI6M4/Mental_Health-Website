						<li><div class=" nutrients"><h1>Nutrients</h1><p>Nutrition is very important for the well being of the human body its is more important than we realise. what we eat affects how we feel and how function. that is impoertant to to be knowledgable about the food that we eat. There are 5 major nutrients that our bodies needs to be balanced. these are proteins which are subdivided into amino acids. then we have carbohydrates wich are a good source of energy. then there exist fats alos scientifically known as lipids which have the function of insulating the body keeping the the body safe in cold conditions and keeping the organs protected from damage. then we need vitamins wich are subdivided into diferent water soluble vitamins and fat soluble vitamins with each having distinct roles in the human anatomy. then we have the minerals.</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="water"><h1>Water</h1><p> Water gets its own mention because it is the solution in which all chemical processes in our bodies are synthesised in. our bodies are made up of 70% water which is an impressive figure and it shows just how important water is. If we have to little water we become dehydrated and that can lead to death. if we have to much water our bodies will be overloded and that causes other problems such as swelling. so it is recommended that we drink at least 2 litres of water every day to have a stable life.</p></div></li>

						<li><div class="balance"><h1>Balance</h1><p>Balance is very important in our bodies if even there exist even a slight imbalance in our bodies this leads to problems such as our bodies run at 37degrees if that figure drops we are open to colds and viruses and if that figure increases we get fevers and start over heating. this delicate balance applies also to the food that we eat. that is why you hear health experts talk about having a balanced diet to regulate your internal balance in your body. thhis ultimately leads to a healthier and improved life </p></div></li>
