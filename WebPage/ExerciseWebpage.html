			<h5 id = "headingVerylight"> VERY LIGHT </h5>
			<p>This is the very low intensity zone. Training at this intensity will boost your recovery and get you ready to train in the higher heart rate zones.
			<br>To train at this intensity, pick sports during which you can easily control your heart rate, such as walking or cycling.</p>

			<h5 id = "headinglight"> LIGHT </h5>
			<p>Exercising in heart rate zone 2 feels light and you should be able to go on for a long time at this intensity.
			<br>This is the zone that improves your general endurance: your body will get better at oxidizing burning fat and
			<br>your muscular fitness will increase along with your capillary density.Training in heart rate zone 2 is an 
			<br>essential part of every runner’s program. Keep at it and you’ll reap the benefits later.</p>

			<h5 id = "headingModerate"> MODERATE </h5>
			<p> Exercising in heart rate zone 3 is especially effective for improving the efficiency of blood circulation in the heart and skeletal muscles.
			<br>This is the zone in which that pesky lactic acid starts building up in your bloodstream.Training in this HR zone will make moderate efforts easier and improve your efficiency.</p>

			<h5 id = "headinghard"> HARD </h5>
			<p>Heart rate zone 4 is where the going gets tough. You’ll be breathing hard and running aerobically.If you train at this intensity, you’ll improve your speed endurance.
			<br>Your body will get better at using carbohydrates for energy and you’ll be able to withstand higher levels of lactic acid in your blood for longer.</p>

		<section id = "main6">
			<h5 id = "headingmaximum"> MAXIMUM </h5>
			<p>Heart rate zone 5 is your maximal effort. Your heart and your blood and respiratory system will be working at their maximal capacity.
			<br>Lactic acid will build up in your blood and after a few minutes you won’t be able to continue at this intensity.
			<br>If you’re just starting out or have only been training for some time, you probably won’t have to train at this intensity.
			<br>If you’re a professional athlete, look into incorporating interval training into your training plan for peak performance.</p>
