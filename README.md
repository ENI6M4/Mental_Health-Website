# HTML-CSS


We all need to create our own branch within this repository

If your page includes links of other pages then they will also be included within your personal branch
Updates won't be done from your branch but the main page cos theres the option to update both

So that our pages match up perfectly when we are doing our own thing

Harneet if you need any help cos of work or whatever, theres no worries we'll help out where needed
cos I think we're at a point where we need to get this out of the way and should be helping each other
